## Hi! My name is Cory Chilton.

I recently graduated from UCLA summa cum laude with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a technical breadth in computer science. I have hands-on coding experience through various personal projects and interning at The Aerospace Corporation as a Software Intern during Summer 2022. As I am a recent graduate, I am looking for a full-time software engineering position starting immediately!
